                A new nova in Cassiopeia, discovered on March 18th, is bright enough to see in a small telescope.

                The new object is located at right ascension 23h 24m 48s, declination +61° 11′ 15″. That’s about 6° northwest of 2nd-magnitude Caph (β Cas) and ½° south of the bright open cluster M52, or if you prefer, ½° east of the Bubble Nebula (NGC 7635). Either way, it’s an easy star-hop from Caph, as shown in the finder chart below. And because Cassiopeia is circumpolar from mid-northern latitudes, the nova is visible all night long. Try to catch it when it’s highest, either right at nightfall or just before dawn. </p> <br>

                <figcaption class="figcaption"  style="width:100%"> In this illustration, the star at right is losing matter through its Roche Lobe to the white dwarf (center). Material first flows into a disk and then spirals down to the dwarf’s surface, where it can later detonate in a thermonuclear explosion. </figcaption> <br>
                <p> When a new nova comes to light, astronomers try to identify it with a previously known star. V1405 lies just 0.12″ from the W UMa-class (denoted EW) eclipsing-binary star CzeV3217, close enough that the latter appears to be the nova’s progenitor. Like nova systems, W UMa-class stars orbit close enough to transfer material through a common “neck” but with a key difference: Both members are main-sequence stars that burn hydrogen like the Sun, not end-of-the-road white dwarfs.When a new nova comes to light, astronomers try to identify it with a previously known star.

                <p> Novae are exciting to watch not just because things are blowing up but also because you get to witness an essential process that makes the universe tick. Through explosive fusion, novae seed space with carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and more. For all you know, some of your very own atoms may have originated in a similar catastrophic event far away and long ago. </p>
